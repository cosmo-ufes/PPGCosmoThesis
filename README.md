Experienced users on LaTex should not find it hard to use these files. First typeset these files as they are, it should work. Latter adapt the files as you wish.

The figures in the folder "figures" are the logos from PPGCosmo and UFES, they can be copied together with this latex code, but are not subjected to the LICENSE.

The PPGCosmoThesis class is based on the document class _scrbook_ from the [_Koma Script_](https://ctan.org/pkg/koma-script). Most users do not need this information, but all the pros and cons of this class will also apply to the PPGCosmoThesis class. See [here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/7742/what-are-the-strengths-and-weaknesses-of-koma-script-and-memoir) for a discussion.

Some of the data present in the example thesis.tex come for the first PPGCosmo defense. The complete thesis you can find [here](https://ppgcosmo.cosmo-ufes.org/emmanuel-frion.html).
